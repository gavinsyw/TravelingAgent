\subsection{Sketch}
In this document, we are going to make some detailed descriptions on system requirements and related models and recount them by the order of function.

\section{System Overview}
Nowadays, people’s life has become better and better because of the reform and opening-up policy. More and more people decide to take a trip instead of staying at home during the holidays. However, since the destination is new to them, people usually can’t come up with a nice plan, which will influence their journey experience greatly. In the past time, people always search for different kinds of strategies and then knock them together. On the other hand, people who are busy studying and working may not have so much time to have a dreamful trip. With great pressure surrounding, a desired trip is unavailable to them.

Therefore, a network-based journey assistant system JAS is being called out. The traveler can plan their trip with this system handily, and of course get the help anytime they want. Our application will provide user with a platform which can assist them to draw up a perfect plan. Additionally, the platform is both professional and entertaining. With this application, user can not only get a detailed and highly-recommended journey plan but also have a virtual journey and feedback as they want. It will help people to fulfill their travel experience. 

We have following functions. 

\paragraph{\underline{Make Plan on City}} After user’s selecting a certain city, system will produce a travel plan according to user’s different requirements.

\paragraph{\underline{Customize a Trip}} Users can select scenic spots one by one, then system will simulate a trip and give user a fact-based experience feedback.

\paragraph{\underline{Give a Feedback}} Users can report the opinions about our system or their usage experience to us by our reporting interface.

\paragraph{\underline{Other Non-functional Requirement}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] The data of users should be protected against vicious hacking.
	\item[2.]	Customization information should be close to fact as much as possible.
	\item[3.]	Normally, the response time of our system should not be longer than 30s.
	\item[4.]	The UI should be beautiful and activate user’s desire to have a trip.
	\item[5.]	Statistics must be made.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Targer System}
\subsection{Sketch}
Our project includes functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements can be summarized as making a plan and customization of tourism, while non-functional requirements consist of response time, security, apperance and so on.

\subsection{Functional Requirement}
JAS provides users a handy tool to organize and manage their journey according to their kinds of requirements. 

First of all, it can help normal users to know more about the destination, such as climate, traffic situation, civilization and so on. After knowing about different places, users will make their mind to choose one or more city as their destination. Then users will get into a filter interfaces. In this interface, users can add conditions as they like which will be used to filter the plans in our alternative set. For example, the number of travelers, whether they have a pet or not, the style they want, the budget and any other requirements. All these demands will be considered in our next plan recommending.

During selecting condition, in order to produce a accurate and practical plan, system will provide users with different choices instead of letting them enter demands arbitrarily.

In addition, JAS also offer a powerful tool to customization a real trip and give users a feedback about experience.

Sometime users may not have time to have a trip, however, they still want to get some experience. With our application, time and money will not be constraints to our users anymore.
They can go through their trip virtually, while our system can give them a real experience.

When users try to enjoy our customization service, they also need to select a city at first. After city is decided, users can begin to choose the scenic spots. Each choice will be sent to the backend. After a nice and related cartoon, system will give a real feedback about this travel experience. Of course, feedback won’t be the same all the time, since we add some related random incidents to it. For example, if you choose a college as your destination, you may have a special experience with cute cats living in it! About the feedback, we will provide three types: some sentences (more sentient), some words (more accurate) and GAN’s perspective (Generative Adversarial Network). 

As a wonderful application, the feedback of users can’t be ignored. With a report interface, we can learn about our drawbacks and advantages in time.

Report will be conveyed to us through backend. When users begin to write a report, there will be two main types to choose: about data and about usage experience. Different types of report will be sent to different developers. 

\subsection{Non-functional Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.]Special security should be taken because the data of users cannot be leaked.
	\item[2.] As a featured function, customization information must be as real as possible, since this is why users choose our application.
	\item[3.]  Response time should be as short as possible and had better not be longer than 30s. A loading flash should be displayed when users are waiting.
	\item[4.] Some data of users should be accessed so that we can make a better and personal recommendation.
	\item[5.]Users interface should be attractive, some related information can be displayed at first.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] Since our application is a handy application, there is no requirement for users themselves.
	\item[2.] Our application need to be updated periodically with normal network.
	\item[3.] Two huge database should be equipped.
	\item[4.] Network should keep normal when users use our function.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] The system will be closed if we need to update or repair it. As for the other time, users can have a nice experience as they want. 
	\item[2.]To keep our application advance with the times, we need to update our database per month. 
	\item[3.] The information should be real absolutely. Description and real experience should be corresponding. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] The system response time (response to users’ request from servers to clients) must less than 30 second, if the network state is normal.
	\item[2.] Our system can deal with 1000 cases simultaneously.
	\item[3.]  The capicity depends on our database and related arithmetic.
	\item[4.] If the network state is abnormal, we can only provide users with off-line mode. In this mode, users can still search for information about scenario from local database.
	\item[5.]To achieve short response time, we need to have a powerful CPU or server to compute rapidly. However, to users, a well network state is the most important.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Supportability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] Our code standard and name rule will obey international rule strictly.
	\item[2.]Only developer can visit our back-end directly. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design Constraint}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] progamming language:Java, python, html and php.
	\item[2.] Java for main code, html and php for front-end, python for arithmetic.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interface}
Detailed interface is to be determined.

\subsubsection{Law, Copyright and Other Notice}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.]This software is created by all us group members together. We, unlearninng group, reserve all the right for the final explanation.
	\item[2.] Journey Assistant is a temporary name for our app, if it causes trademark infringement, welcome contact with us.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applicable Standard}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] We are decided to produce an andorid software, hence it should obey the standard of andorid.
	\item[2.] The main language of our app is Chinese, English version is to be determined.
	
\end{itemize}
